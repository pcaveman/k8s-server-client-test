Plan:
1) What is service mesh
2) What is proxy envoy. Sidecar
3) What additional data we have when we use istio
4) Using istio metrics for to get the same info that we implemented in business logic
5) Results of testing and features to research
  - TCP features are limited in the sense of splitting the traffic
  - usage of istio with multi cluster environment to balance traffic to be explored
  - google service mesh (traffic director) also uses envoy proxies but uses other approach than istio

What should be configured:
- microk8s running
- deliver our application: 
  - k apply -f k8s/cluster.yaml
- install istioctl
- describe cluster for istio: 
  - microk8s config > ~/.kube/config
- add path to istioctl in .bashrc
- install istio panel in k8s cluster: istioctl install --set profile=demo 
- add our namespace to those that istio will provide Sidecar for
  - k label namespace server-ns istio-injection=enabled
- install grafana, prometheus, etc
  - change services from ClusterIp -> NodePort (with nodePort: 3000X)
  - k apply -f istio-1.22.3/samples/addons
